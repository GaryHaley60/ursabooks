                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Major Ursa’s love of fantasy and science fiction
                            began as a child lost in the worlds created by Andre
                            Norton. Her characters were true heroes. They walked
                            the paths of honor even when it came at a price.
                            That lesson became a part of Ursa’s own life. Major
                            Ursa made his first forays into fantasy gaming in
                            1980. Soon, he was creating worlds and adventures to
                            entertain friends and family. The games became
                            stories to entertain his children and grandchildren.
                            Somewhere along the way, entertainment turned into
                            teaching about honor and sacrifice and ways to
                            persevere when things were hard. Now, the old bear
                            is putting his favorite tales in print. The world
                            needs heroes, even fictional ones, that are willing
                            to put the needs of others before their own desires.

                            <em><strong>About the Pen Name</strong></em>
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The origin of my pen name goes back to ancient
                            history when I was a swimmer in high school. I
                            picked up the nickname of "The Bear" for somewhat
                            obvious reasons. Instead of being the jibe it was
                            intended to be, it became a mark of pride. Over the
                            years I grew to love my namesakes and would visit
                            them in every zoo or national park I could. The
                            constellation Ursa Major, aka the Great Bear, became
                            one of my favorites. After high school, I attended
                            the United States Air Force Academy. I served for 21
                            years after receiving my commission and retired with
                            the rank of Major. Ursa Major and eventually Major
                            Ursa became my on-line gaming name. When I decided
                            to write my stories, it seemed only natural to write
                            as Major Ursa. And so, Major Ursa began a new series
                            of adventures in a realm unknown to him. He is
                            looking for companions and hopes you will join him
                            at Ursa Books.

                            <p>
                                I try to keep the writing level simple so that
                                everyone of all ages can enjoy my stories. So
                                you won't find any large, fancy words when
                                simple daily use words will do. Typos happen,
                                I'm blind. Sometimes they are on purpose, like
                                when Shorty is speaking. Others are honest
                                mistakes that several friends and editors failed
                                to find. If you find one, let me know.
