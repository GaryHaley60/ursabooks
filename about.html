            <p> Major Ursa’s love of fantasy and science fiction began as a child lost in the worlds created by Andre Norton. Her characters were true heroes. They walked the paths of honor even when it came at a price. That lesson became a part of Ursa’s own life.
        
            Major Ursa made his first forays into fantasy gaming in 1980. Soon, he was creating worlds and adventures to entertain friends and family. The games became stories to entertain his children and grandchildren. Somewhere along the way, entertainment turned into teaching about honor and sacrifice and ways to persevere when things were hard. Now, the old bear is putting his favorite tales in print. The world needs heroes, even fictional ones, that are willing to put the needs of others before their own desires.

            <h2 class="serif"><em><strong>Writing Style</strong></em></h2>
              <p>I try to keep the writing level simple so that everyone of all ages can enjoy my stories. So you won't find any large, fancy words when simple daily use words will do. Typos happen, I'm blind. Sometimes they are on purpose, like when Shorty is speaking. Others are honest mistakes that several friends and editors failed to find. If you find one let me know.

        <p>I would love to hear from you and how you feel after reading my stories. Do they excite you? Do you connect with them? Can you suggest ways to improve? Of course, if you love the book, rate and/or review the book so it reaches a larger audience.
