                    <p>
                        It has been near 2000 years since the Great Change when
                        mortals nearly destroyed our world with their search for
                        power. We were lucky to survive our own madness. There
                        were many changes not the least of which was the birth
                        of the races of dwarf, elf, halfling, and many others.
                        Magic was also born to our world. Since that time, the
                        Elves and the Druids have done much to restore and heal
                        this land. That is especially true here in the North
                        near the Lake Country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now the races once again face a crossroads. Evil again
                        threatens our world. But instead of banding together,
                        the races squabble amongst themselves. Each is seeking
                        dominance over its neighbors. Individuals again seek
                        power and attempt to use that power to subjugate all.
                        And we watch. You waste precious time drinking and
                        gossiping in a seedy tavern such as this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Chaos erupted in the Inn as the old Bard finished his
                        warning. Five strangers stood between his killers and
                        the village locals. Now they are on the run, trying to
                        survive and maybe prevent a war between the mortal
                        races. Saving the world was not their goal, but they
                        quickly learn that it is a short path to becoming
                        heroes.
